original.js contains the original JavaScript code, which I then converted into something in more of an OOP style.

Now featuring improved tactics on the part of the computer opponent.

## Improvements

There's always room for improvement.

- Introduce a Player class and a child Computer class.
- Add the possibility of choosing a 2-person game or 1-person vs. computer
- Alternate starting player
- Make the page look a little nicer, I guess.
