# tic-tac-toe

Live at [https://nbarnabee.github.io/tic-tac-toe/](https://nbarnabee.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

/old/original.js contains the original JavaScript code, which I then converted into something in more of an OOP style.

Latest update (5 September 2023):  I finally got around to alternating the starting player.  The first player of the first round will be randomly chosen.  The game will also track ties and the round number.

## Improvements

There's always room for improvement.

- Introduce a Player class and a child Computer class.
- Add the possibility of choosing a 2-person game or 1-person vs. computer
- Make the page look a little nicer, I guess.
