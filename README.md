# tic-tac-toe

A small project written as part of my #100Devs bootcamp.  

original.js contains the original JavaScript code, which I then converted (badly) into something in more of an OOP style, as per the assignment instructions.  

Now featuring improved tactics on the part of the computer opponent.


## Improvements ##

There's always room for improvement.  
- Introduce a Player class and a child Computer class.
- Add the possibility of choosing a 2-person game or 1-person vs. computer
- Insert a delay between turns; current the computer takes its turn immediately, which feels a bit rushed.  (That would mean that I would need to disable and reenable the buttons between rounds, or in some other way prevent the human from continuing to make moves.)
- Make the page look a little nicer, I guess.
